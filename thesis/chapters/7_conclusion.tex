% even if you already implemented these solutions by hand, you no longer have to -> you have more time -> you can spend that time implementing more advanced best practices

\textit{GreatAI} might have the potential to bridge the gap between data science and software engineering. Stemming from the bidirectional nature of bridges, we can look at the framework from two perspectives: for professionals closer to the field of data science, it provides an automatic scaffolding of software facilities that are required for deploying, monitoring, and iterating on their models. For software engineers, it highlights the necessary steps required for robust and improvable deployments, while at the same time saves them from the menial work of implementing these constructs. While most importantly, it serves as a proxy for the design decisions through which they can be tested and evaluated in their practical context.
